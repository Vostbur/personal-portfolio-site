Personal site with portfolio, blog and contact form

This is a simple Django project that can be written in a couple of hours and is inspired of an example from the training course ["Django 3 - Full Stack Websites with Python Web Development"](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-3-make-websites-with-python-tutorial-beginner-learn-bootstrap/).

As a template, I used the free bootstrap theme ["Stanley"](https://usebootstrap.com/theme/stanley). 

The demo is available on [Pythonanywhere](https://vostbur.pythonanywhere.com/).
